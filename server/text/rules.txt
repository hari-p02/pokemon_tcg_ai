# Pokémon Trading Card Game Official Rulebook

## Pokémon TCG Basic Concepts

The Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) is a two-player strategy card game where players assume the role of Pokémon Trainers. Using a deck of 60 cards containing Pokémon, Energy, and Trainer cards, players battle by placing Pokémon on the field and attacking their opponent's Pokémon. The game simulates Pokémon battles from the video games and anime series.

## How to Win

There are three ways to win a Pokémon TCG game:
1. Take all of your Prize cards (typically 6).
2. Knock Out all of your opponent's Pokémon in play.
3. If your opponent has no cards left in their deck at the beginning of their turn.

## Energy Types

Energy cards power your Pokémon's attacks. There are 11 Energy types:
- Grass: Plant/Insect Pokémon (green)
- Fire: Fire/Volcanic Pokémon (red)
- Water: Aquatic/Marine Pokémon (blue)
- Lightning: Electric Pokémon (yellow)
- Psychic: Psychic/Ghost Pokémon (purple)
- Fighting: Combat/Rock Pokémon (orange/brown)
- Darkness: Dark/Evil Pokémon (black)
- Metal: Steel/Machine Pokémon (gray)
- Fairy: Fairy/Mythical Pokémon (pink)
- Dragon: Dragon Pokémon (gold/multicolored)
- Colorless: Normal/Flying Pokémon (white/clear)

Most Energy cards provide one Energy of their type. Special Energy cards may provide different types or multiple Energy at once.
