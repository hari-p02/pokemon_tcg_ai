   ```

2. Set your Anthropic API key as an environment variable:
   ```
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

3. Run the example:
   ```
   python anthropic_langchain_example.py
   ```

## Example Details

The example demonstrates:
- Setting up a ChatAnthropic model
- Creating a prompt template
- Setting up a chain to process the prompt through the model
- Getting a response to a question about Pok√©mon

## Notes
